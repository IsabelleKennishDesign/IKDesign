											<h3>Brisbane Art Canvas</h3>
											<p>In this assessment we had to create a guide that would be for the Brisbane Canvas artwork all around the city. This brief including designing, layout, type design and creating easy to read maps along with time tables of transport.</p>
											<p>Since this booklet was all about art I had created a guide that was about embracing the urban beauty these artworks about the city displayed. It was made with fun, but still held itself as a useful guide that was easy to read and understand. </p>

											<h3>Cosemetic Package Branding</h3>
											<p>The branding project was to create a brand for a cosmetic line. For this I was  I had to create and decide on fonts, logo, branding style, colour palette and expression of the brand.</p>
											<p>Yangaba, the cosmetic I made and had to brand, was an organic, australian owned make up line that was to appeal to the ones who love luxe and the earth. I made the decision to create the band in a earthly and floral tones with the organic feel that was too straight and neat. But fun, messy and beautiful, creating the message for what the brand was about. </p>
