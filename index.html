											<h3>On Branding</h3>
											<p>For this brief we had to create a brand for a location. This included a logo, colour scheme and document style.</P>
											<p>I had chosen Orange, NSW. And due to it’s rich culture and history  decided to go for a vintage look and picked a colour palette that was emblematic of the food and wine it is famous for and the beautiful change in it’s season from classically hot Australia to the cool winter’s it experiences.  </p>

											<h3>Lyrical Type Design</h3>
											<p>This project was about creating a type and design for a song lyric that encapsulated the feel and message of the song.</p>
											<p>For this the lyrics from Lykki Li’s ‘I follow river’ was used, the lyrics being be the ocean. The song was about resilience in love and self and to be ready for the changes that life will bring. So I had used water paints for the type and used images to create a collage that felt reminiscent to the song. </p>

											<h3>Brisbane Art Canvas</h3>
											<p>In this assessment we had to create a guide that would be for the Brisbane Canvas artwork all around the city. This brief including designing, layout, type design and creating easy to read maps along with time tables of transport.</p>
											<p>Since this booklet was all about art I had created a guide that was about embracing the urban beauty these artworks about the city displayed. It was made with fun, but still held itself as a useful guide that was easy to read and understand. </p>

											<h3>Cosemetic Package Branding</h3>
											<p>The branding project was to create a brand for a cosmetic line. For this I was  I had to create and decide on fonts, logo, branding style, colour palette and expression of the brand.</p>
											<p>Yangaba, the cosmetic I made and had to brand, was an organic, australian owned make up line that was to appeal to the ones who love luxe and the earth. I made the decision to create the band in a earthly and floral tones with the organic feel that was too straight and neat. But fun, messy and beautiful, creating the message for what the brand was about. </p>

											<h3>Movie Poster Redesign</h3>
											<p>This  project was about picking an already movie and designing a poster in a different time period to then when it was released.</p> 
											<p>I had the 1975 thriller ‘Jaws’  and had set the poster design period to the early 2000’s which was huge on photography collages and simple large fonts. We were limited with using the royalty free images and to follow the movie poster guidelines for naming actors, studios and ratings etc.   </p>

											<h3>Editorial Design</h3>
											<p>With this brief we had to create a editorial on a phobia. My job included creating  layout, design and typography.</p>
